You can use this tool for downloading the desired tiles from a tiled dataset by selecting features of a tile-index layer. 
For the Netherlands there is <a href="http://www.ahn.nl">high-resolution elevation data</a> available for free download. 
This dataset consists of over 1000 tiles.  You can add the tile-index to the mapcanvas by opening one of the WFS-layers. 
<BR>
<BR>
In the configuration we already included some url's from the <a href="https://www.pdok.nl/nl/producten/pdok-downloads/atomfeeds">Dutch geoportal</a>. 
The reference to a specific tile is replaced with the string <strong>'[ifield]'</strong>. 
During the download session, this tag is being replaced with the chosen attribute.

Although this tool was created especially for the Dutch elevation data, there probably are other datasets that can be retrieved using this tool. 
Please keep us informed about your findings.
